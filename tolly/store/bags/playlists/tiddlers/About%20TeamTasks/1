title: About TeamTasks

A quick start guide is provided in the [[Getting Started with TeamTasks]] tiddler.

This application has been built using TiddlyWiki and requires several plugins to function.  For an up-to-date list of the plugins used, and other building blocks required to build TeamTasks, take a look at the [[Release Notes]].

TeamTasks also require some definitions, which you can modify and add to as required:
UserDefinitions
PriorityDefinitions
ScopeDefinitions
StatusDefinitions
