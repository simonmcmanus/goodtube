A plugin that adds an S5 serializer to TiddlyWeb, for
use when viewing a list of tiddlers. See the docstring
for more details.

See http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ for more on S5.

Issues:

* The path to the static stuff needs to be templatized to
  deal with people who have a prefix or are using a different
  location for static content.
* There's currently no way to control the order of slides,
  which is a bit of a bummer.
* Incremental exposure of slides has not yet been explored.
